## Student Database Part 1

For this project I had to write a bash script designed to insert data from CSV files (courses.csv and students.csv) into a PostgreSQL database named "students." The SQL dump contains the necessary commands to create and populate the tables for the "courses," "majors," "majors_courses," and "students" in the "public" schema of the "students" database.

I learned how to automate data insertion into a PostgreSQL database, create tables with primary keys and foreign key constraints, handle database sequences for auto-incrementing IDs, and perform basic SQL operations such as SELECT, INSERT, and conditional statements for data validation during the insertion process. Additionally, I gained practical experience in managing relational databases, understanding schema relationships, and setting up a database structure for student-related data, including courses and majors.
