## Student Database Part 2

For this project, I wrote a Bash script to connect to a PostgreSQL database named "students" and executed a series of SQL queries to retrieve specific information about computer science students. I used the psql command-line tool and SQL commands to filter and extract data from the database based on various criteria.

During this process, I learned how to interact with a PostgreSQL database using Bash scripting, execute SQL queries with specified conditions and filtering criteria, and use different SQL functions like AVG(), COUNT(), ROUND(), ILIKE, and ORDER BY to obtain meaningful insights from the database. I also practiced joining tables to retrieve information from related tables, managing NULL values, and using conditional expressions to extract relevant data.
