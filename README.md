## RELATIONAL DATABASE - FreeCodeCamp
#### This is a repository of my SQL projects from the 'Relational Database' section of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

With these projects, I learned how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases. I also improved my scripting skills by writing simple Bash scripts to automate queries.
